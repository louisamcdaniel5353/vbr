2K20 MyPlayer CHEAT SHEET v2. MyCAREER. Hey, I posted something similar to this right before the Demo dropped, but it was all based off of rumors. I played the Demo a lot yesterday and found this sheet was pretty useful to keep track of all the players I made and the minor changes (8 Players to be exact).  · Ctrl+Num 1 – All Scores Count Toward Player. Ctrl+Num 2 – Infinite Stamina. Ctrl+Num 3 – No Fatigue. Ctrl+Num 4 – Freeze Timer. Ctrl+Num 5 – End Current Quarter. Ctrl+Num 6 – Freeze Shot Clock. Ctrl+Num 7 – Instant Shot Clock Violation. Ctrl+Num 8 – MyGM: Infinite Skill Points. Ctrl+Num 9 – MyGM: Unlock All Skills.  · Our NBA 2K20 trainer has 8 cheats and supports Steam. Cheat in this game and more with the WeMod app!
