Welcome to the world of Pokemon Emerald. Like me, I also enjoyed playing the game. But to make it more fun, it would be best to tweak the game a little bit using Pokemon Emerald cheats.. In Pokemon gaming, there are several favorite cheats used by gamers; they are the Walk Through Walls, Rare Candy, Master ball, wild Pokemon modifier, and Legendary.  · Cheat code. Alternative code (Codebreaker) D AD 8BBF7 8CEBA. Note: The cheat doesn’t need master code. Check Pokemart and purchase Master ball for 0. For Android users, the cheat perfectly works for My Boy! – GBA Emulator and John GBA – GBA emulator. 11 rows ·  · If you're playing on an emulator, you can still enable cheat codes.
