 · Terraria [Steam] [UPDATED] [Help] Post by MisleadingDragon» Sat pm can someone update the 64bit version of the tmodloader cheat table, because once you use it, it consists to stay connected on one character and you can't end up using it on a new character --this really bothers me but i don't know how to fix.  · Terraria got released a day ago with some new engine updates. Here is the updated table for it. (tested working as on Terraria version - Steam) Credit goes to justa_dude. I just update his old table and add some more cheats to it. If there's something you desire, please mention it. I will try to work on it.  · When before I think there's an option to change item amount and ID in the table There is already a method to do just that. You can replace any item by going to "LocalPlayer->My Player->Item->Slot1" and changing netID with the ID of the item you want.
