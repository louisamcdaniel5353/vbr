 · Our NBA 2K20 +13 trainer is now available for version and supports STEAM. These NBA 2K20 cheats are designed to enhance your experience with the game. 2K20 MyPlayer CHEAT SHEET v2. MyCAREER. Hey, I posted something similar to this right before the Demo dropped, but it was all based off of rumors. I played the Demo a lot yesterday and found this sheet was pretty useful to keep track of all the players I made and the minor changes (8 Players to be exact).  · My CT knowledge ist limited. So what i did: i scanned the value then i did the next scan and then i set a new value. After i maxed out i can't continue because it freezed to the limited build points. Then i went back to Ct and set the value to 0 and i could finish the build. The potential is 99 but my player has only 60 overall.
