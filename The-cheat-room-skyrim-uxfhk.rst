 · For The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition on the Xbox One, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Can anyone help me learn how to use Cheat Room's Cheat Menu?"%(24).  · Cheat room - posted in Skyrim Special Edition Mod Talk: Anyone know what happened to it or if its coming back? Or if theres an alternative? For my 18,th play through, I just want to God mode, get all of my perks, etc set and have all of the crafting supplies I need without having to use console commands. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks. Hello community, I wanted to install the good old cheat room mod for Skyrim SE (well AE, "thanks Bethesda"). But now it seems that this mod nowhere to be found and on another unrelated note, my mods options are gone from my main menu.
