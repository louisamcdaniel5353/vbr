 · HP cheat:  health # Increase the Gamespeed of all NPCs & the User (Default is 4) setgs fmoverunmult # Increases maximum carry weight by number 84%(39).  · Accepted Answer Yeah, the higher your luck is, the higher your chances of winning, which are still pretty low anyways. Roulette + Luck = Higher chance of it stopping on 84%(81). The second is a known cheat for Fallout 3 that works in New Vegas as well. Slot Machine override. If you loose in any of the gambles and reload .
