I prefer the PC version and also I played the same as you my career and franchise offline. The game went to crap when they started catering to the online players I guess that's where all the money is at the VC garbage. Is the cheat engine the same as last year. The best place to get cheats, codes, cheat codes, walkthrough, guide, FAQ, unlockables, tricks, and secrets for NBA 2K20 for PC. How do I use the cheats in NBA 2K20? WeMod will safely display all of the games on your PC. Open a game from the list and simply press play. After the game loads and once you’re in-game, you can start enabling different cheats! Will this work with my game version?
