 · Hey guys today me and Robo played Human Fall Flat Christmas edition, and I also tried to teach you guys a NEW trick/glitch on how to FLY on this game.I hope.  · Fly forever command. I was once at a server and then for some reason, everyone could jump forever and fly. They didn't tell me the command. Anyone know the name for it is, the only command I know is fps. It’s not a command. It’s a bug that occurs randomly. The dev is aware of this and will bring out a fix in the next update. Question for Human: Fall Flat. Are there any flying cheat codes?
